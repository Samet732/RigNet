# Core Python dependencies (pure-Python / pip-installable)
# Pin versions to be broadly compatible with modern Colab runtimes (Python 3.8-3.10/3.11).
numpy>=1.21,<2.0
scipy>=1.7
matplotlib>=3.3
tensorboard>=2.8
opencv-python>=4.5
trimesh[easy]>=3.9
open3d>=0.14
rtree>=0.8,<1.0
# Note: torch and torch-geometric (pyg) are NOT pinned here because they require
# special wheels matching the installed CUDA/PyTorch combination. See COLAB_SETUP.md
# to install the correct versions on Colab or your local machine.
